# Yozakura Licenses

Original page on Yozakura: [https://yozakura.me/licenses](https://yozakura.me/licenses)

Yozakura and every affiliated creator **reject and fight Generative AI** due
to the way it works: **by stealing creative works by artists** and mixing and
matching them with no permission while providing no attribution nor
compensation.  
We struggled to find licenses that protect us and our works from AI, so for this
purpose, we decided to create our own and give creators a tool to protect
themselves from those who shamelessly steal creative works for their own
gain:  
+ [Yozakura Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-NoAI 1.0 International Public License](https://github.com/YozakuraYZK/licenses/blob/main/by-nc-sa-noai-1.0.txt) (BY-NC-SA-NoAI)

**You don't need to be part of Yozakura to use our licenses:** as a matter of
fact, we encourage everyone to feel free to use them! Please bear in mind that
using our licenses doesn't automatically allow you to associate yourself with
Yozakura and our creators.  
And of course, our licenses are and will always be free to use
([although donations are kindly appreciated!](https://ko-fi.com/exentio)).  

Despite our licenses being heavily based on Creative Commons licenses, we have
to make clear that we are in no way affiliated with them.
